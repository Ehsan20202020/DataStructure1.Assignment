# DataStructure1.Assignment
First assingment of data staructure
The program will read the file named "veriler.txt" as it runs. Each line contains two-digit numbers separated by a space.
The number of lines in the file and the number of numbers on each line can vary.
The numbers will be extracted and placed into the structure.
the tens digit of each number in every row is placed in an upward direction on a singly linked list.
The ones digit, on the other hand, is placed in a downward direction on another singly linked list.
After the placement is completed, the user will be prompted to enter two index positions.

Position A: Represents the upward direction lists.

Position B: Represents the downward direction lists.

For example, when the following values are entered, the lists will switch places:
Position A: 0
Position B: 2

The final shape, the first nodes of the upward and downward lists will be combined by taking their averages,
and the second nodes will be combined in the same manner.
